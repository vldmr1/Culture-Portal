  "main_page_introduction": "Belarusian literature appeared at the beginning of the 20th century due to the possibility of publishing not only Russian literature, but also literature of other nationalities. The first Belarusian publicists were Yanka Kupala and Yakub Kolas, who took the ideas of writing their works from Maxim Gorky. Their followers are no less famous poets, such as Maksim Bogdanovich, Ryhor Baradulin, Zmitrok Byadulia. They also create the first community of Belarusian-speaking writers. Later, this community split up into a large number of small associations of writers, but as a result, all the writers had to gather back together anyway, due to the incomplete formation of a separate cell of Belarusian literature under the influence of literature of other nationalities. Also, relying on the works of poets of the 20-30s, modern poets also write their works, who speak about their predecessors only in warm words. But in modern Belarus, as statistics show, too few people are interested in the Belarusian literature, more and more people are moving towards the Russian language. Less and less people can speak the Belarusian language, and only a few can name modern Belarusian authors. In honor of the memory of the Belarusian writers who formed the Belarusian literature, as well as to remind about their work, this portal was created, where one can get acquainted with the works of Belarusian poets and their biography.",
